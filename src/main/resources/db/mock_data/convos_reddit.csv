disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition
let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower
either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they re doing this time around
republicans have always battled with severe cases of selective amnesia
politics were so different back then people on both sides had to at least pretend to be reasonable  http  wwwnytimescom19871112usreagannominatesanthonykennedytosupremecourthtml  pagewanted  all
equally ridiculous  here s a 1970 law review article in which mcconnell argues for presidential dominion in the supreme court nomination process http  imgurcompbeveod
somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark

i ve never met anyone in real life that knows who elizabeth warren is  which is unfortunate
if he goes up against hillary he just might win it
classy  is nt the president normally reserved on giving their opinion of the upcoming general election
i noticed the  math  is only based on loss of tax revenue  and does nt take into account his proposed spending cuts i feel as though i m missing a good amount of context here
i d like to know how he intends to cut  860 billion from the budget each year
is there any logical reason to support this  or do cruz supporters just not understand the issues
maybe a subliminal attack on cruz

thank you  gop  for making me think of cruz whenever i hear  canada   yet another thing you spoiled for me
gt   it  s pretty funny  isn  t it   he told the cbc  it  s a goodlooking video  no doubt  but it  s pretty recognizable as vancouver  as a freelancer for stock photo and video sites  chavasse doesn  t usually get to see where his work ends up  and this gave him a  good laugh  gt   i  m not exactly a big republican fan or a rubio supporter   he said  but he noted that  it  s always cool to see your stuff being used  he thinks the campaign probably paid about  80 for the clip  lol
maybe the full title is morning again in  north  america
i do nt know if this is a dig at cruz or a rubio facepalm

he was polling at like 35  among hispanics a few months ago with his recent surge i would nt be surprised if he was tied with her or even ahead now
this should be trump s theme song wherever he goes  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  trujr8evgbg
he brings up two random supporters to speak for him at a rally that s amazing one is a vet and the crowd went wild cheering  usa usa usa  we need this in america again
do not let his size fool you  he is a nimble navigator
kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork
ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users

this was actually pretty awesome and holy crap  trump was right  the press wo nt mention or talk about all the terrible foul language the protester used against everyone and how she started swinging at everyone calling it now  tonight or tomorrow headline stories of  trump brings rally members to the stage to praise them for manhandling tiny female protester with excessive force
